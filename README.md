# Anti-India Detection System

## Overview

The Anti-India Detection System is a project aimed at identifying and flagging content that contains anti-India sentiment across digital platforms. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze and detect potentially harmful or sensitive content efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Automated Content Scanning**: Analyzes text data for anti-India sentiment using advanced algorithms.
- **Customizable Detection**: Fine-tune detection parameters for different platforms and sources.
- **Reporting & Dashboard**: Provides actionable reports and an interactive dashboard for monitoring flagged content.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily integrates additional data sources and detection logic.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses both supervised and unsupervised techniques for high accuracy.

## Prototype

A live prototype of the Anti-India Detection System is available for testing and demonstration.  
**Prototype Link**: [Streamlit App](https://anti-india-detection-system.streamlit.app/)

The prototype allows users to input textual data and visualize detection outputs. It demonstrates the core detection capabilities and reporting features in a user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Om-ingle/anti-india-detection-system.git
   cd anti-india-detection-system
   ```
